    <p><strong>What? </strong><br/>
Empirical research is a study whose conclusions are drawn purely on verifiable, reliable empirical evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong><br/>
You've probably heard the saying, "I won't believe it until I see it.‚ÄùWhen gathering data in a specified, unbiased manner is required, empirical approaches are applied. 
This systematic data gathering makes sure that the information is reliable and free of prejudice. When gathering evidence, scholars frequently commence by using empirical approaches. 
Given the numerous fundamental benefits of this approach, doing so is often a wise decision. 
In order to increasethe relevance of the study conducted on social or academic challenges, empirical investigations use the existing knowledge bases and expand and refine
them.</p>
<p><strong>How? </strong><br/>
The approaches for collecting this empirical evidence might be both quantitative and qualitative. You can gather your data using a different strategy by
examining and analysing current data from differing perspectives, establishing insightful comparisons, or creating intriguing analogies. You have various
options for gathering your data, including surveys, assessments, interviews and focus groups.</p>

    <p><strong>What? </strong><br/>
    A non-empirical dissertation uses previously published work or other materials and offers novel analysis, criticism, and justification without introducing new data.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong><br/>
The foundation for non-empirical evidence lies in a variety of publications. Non-empirical data is also the cornerstone of insightful review articles. In these pieces, the author attempts to condense ideas that are well-versed in order to demonstrate the concept's applicability to many facets of society. It is employed in theory writings whenever the author wants to provide a fresh idea or strengthen the implications of an existing theory.
</p>
<p><strong>How? </strong><br/>
Comprehensive publications and reviews focusing on methods might be considered non-empirical research. Despite not necessarily being primarily data-driven, it must draw on literature from empirical studies. Rather than being solely subjective conversations, every one of these publications must be analytical and contain information substantiated by evidence. Another non-empirical source that attempts to justify why a different researcher's work was flawed is criticism.</p>
